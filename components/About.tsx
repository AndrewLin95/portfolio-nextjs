      <p>
        Hey there! I am a self-taught software developer with a high affinity
        for learning new technologies and applying them to new projects and
        environments.
      </p>
      <p className="italic">
        Being able to see the outcome of my work and the impact it has to my
        users is one of the things I enjoy most.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find the problem solving and challenging nature of software
        development exciting. I am entralled by coming up with new software
        project ideas, applying new technologies and discovering how things
        work.
      </p>
